    <h2>The Amazing Arcade Booth!</h2>
    <h3>Our booth will feature the following games:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Space Turtles</li>
        <li>Turtle Invaders</li>
        <li>Shoot The Turtles!</li>
        <li>Slithering Snakes: A Game</li>
        <li>Pong</li>
        <li>Quizzler: A Trivia Game</li>
        <li><em><b>Plus, a claw machine!</b></em></li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h3>There will be a barcode arcade card system with seperate accounts, each one of them containing the money added to that account and your digital game rewards (tickets)! Your money will be kept securely, and the system also 
    makes it easier for you so you can put in money earlier, then come back and spend it. No more carrying physical tickets, all you need is your Amazing Arcade Card.</h3>
    <br />
    <h3><em>Also, </em>every game and our Arcade Card system were programmed ourselves!</h3>
    
    <h2>From The Children's Business Fair Website!</h2>
    <p>Observe the opportunity for children to launch their very own startup business! Kids develop a brand, create a product or service, build a marketing strategy, and then open for customers at our one-day marketplace. We will host 100+ booths at the 8th annual event on September-20th from 12:00 PM - 5:00 PM.
        This event is sponsored by Mathnasium, C0deEx, Huntington Learning Center, AB STEAM, Northern Bank, Acton Lions Club, Solid Works, Dunkin-The Pesce Network, The Silver Unicorn Book store, West Side Creamery, ActonTV, Town Of Acton Economic Development Office, Acton Academy, The Acton School of Business, and the generous support of our donors and volunteers.  We all believe that principled entrepreneurs are heroes and role models for the next generation.
        Whether an entrepreneur is famous like Jeff Bezos or Oprah Winfrey or they are one of the thousands of unsung business owners across this country, these are the people who make sacrifices to innovate, create jobs and serve their communities.
